# Automated_Speech_Recognition_using_Viterbi_Algorithm
 
A hidden markov model can be used to infer the hidden states based on a set of observations. A popular technique of doing this is known as the Viterbi Algorithm. In this problem, I demonstrate how, given a binary bit pattern generated from human speech, it is possible to infer the spoken syllabes from the set of observation.
